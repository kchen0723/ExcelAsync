A user-defined function called by a formula in a worksheet cell cannot change the environment of Microsoft Excel. This means that such a function cannot do any of the following:
    Insert, delete, or format cells on the spreadsheet.
    Change another cell's value.
    Move, rename, delete, or add sheets to a workbook.
    Change any of the environment options, such as calculation mode or screen views.
    Add names to a workbook.
    Set properties or execute most methods. 

And UDF will ignore application.ontime statement.
